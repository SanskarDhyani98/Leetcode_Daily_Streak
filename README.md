# LeetCode Daily Challenge

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Sanskar Dhyani, a 2nd-year student at NIT Jalandhar, about to enter the 4th semester. This GitHub repository is dedicated to my journey of solving one LeetCode question daily. My primary goal is to strengthen my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, which I felt went slack during the previous semester due to my own laziness.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this daily challenge is to consistently practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. By solving a variety of LeetCode questions, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills, optimize code efficiency, and explore different algorithms and data structures.

## Structure of the Repository
- **Daily Challenges:** Each day, I will be adding a new folder with the date as the name. Inside each folder, you can find the LeetCode problem statement along with my solution in a programming language (mention the language you are using).
- **Solutions:** You can find detailed explanations and video solutions for each problem on  [YouTube Channel]"Codestory with Mike".

## Resources
I find inspiration and guidance from the "Codestory with Mike" YouTube channel. The video solutions provided there help me understand different approaches to solving problems.

## Contact
Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn][www.linkedin.com/in/sanskar-dhyani-593239253] if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to discuss coding!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
